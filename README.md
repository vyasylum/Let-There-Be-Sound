# Let-There-Be-Sound

The project “Let There Be Sound” carries a mission to assist the blind and visually impaired to use the computer with their voice and read documents and handwriting. This application is designed in such a way which can help them read as well as operate basic tasks. It also helps them convert Text to Braille and vice-versa. The voice assistant has been developed with python and several APIs. The OCR can read any document(pdf, word, text as well as image). With the help of a pre-trained CNN model handwriting recognition was possible, so that it makes it opportune for visually impaired people to read handwritten documents. This project will be exceedingly beneficial for students as well.

# WebViewer - Electron sample

[WebViewer](https://www.pdftron.com/documentation/web/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that's part of the [PDFTron PDF SDK](https://www.pdftron.com). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.
