# Let-There-Be-Sound

The project “Let There Be Sound” carries a mission to assist the blind and visually impaired to use the computer with their voice and read documents and handwriting. This application is designed in such a way which can help them read as well as operate basic tasks.

We plan to develop this program into a feature rich application that can be used as a voice assistant and not be limited as a special aid but a tool for students.
